This is a high performance Twitch Bot written in Rust.

## Installing and Running

You can download an installer or an archive from [releases](https://github.com/udoprog/setmod/releases) or [build the project yourself](#building).

If you installed using an installer, SetMod will be in your start folder.
Once started, it shows up as a systray icon.

If you use an archive, you can unpack it in any directory.

It is suggested that you run the bot through `setmod.ps1` since that will run the bot in a loop in case it crashes or is shut down through Twitch.
On Windows, this can be done by right clicking and selecting `Run with PowerShell`.

## Migrating from 0.2 to 0.3

SetMod 0.3 completely removes the need for any configuration files.
Everything is now managed through the `Settings` page in the UI.

We've also moved where we expect the database to be, so if you have an old `0.2` database and a `config.toml` file you'll have to move it like this:

1. Install SetMod `0.3.x`
2. Start SetMod through the Start Menu.
3. When SetMod is running it has a systray icon.
   Click on it and select `Open Directory...`.
4. Quit SetMod.
5. Copy the following files into the directory that you just opened:
   * Your old `config.toml`
   * Your old `*.sql` database, which must be renamed to `setmod.sql`.
6. Start SetMod again. This time it will migrate any existing configuration.
7. Remove `config.toml`.

## Building

You'll need Rust and a working compiler: https://rustup.rs/

For now and until `async_await` is stable, you will need to use the _nightly_ rust compiler.
This can be installed and configured by running:

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

On **Windows**, you will need to setup some environment variables.
You can do that in PowerShell by running the following in the shell:

```
./tools/env.ps1
```

After this, you build the project using cargo:

```
cargo +nightly build --release
```

If you want to build and run the project in one go, there is a helper script in [`tools/setmod.ps1`] that you can run from anywhere in a powershell terminal, like this:

```
C:\setmod\> C:\Projects\setmod\tools\setmod.ps1
```

[`tools/setmod.ps1`]: tools/setmod.ps1

## Settings

SetMod is moving towards storing settings in the database.

These settings are stored as slash-separated strings, like `player/max-songs-per-user`.

You can find all available settings and their types in [`settings.yaml`](bot/src/settings.yaml).

When the bot is running, you can find all settings under `Internal -> Settings`.

## YouTube Player

setmod has support for playing YouTube videos.

This is enabled through the `song/youtube/support` setting and requires you to run the YouTube Player in the web UI.

This can be embedded in OBS with the following Custom CSS:

```css
body { background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); }
.overlay-hidden { display: none };
```

This will cause the player to disappear while it is not playing anything.

## Built-in Commands

#### `!admin`

All admin commands are restricted to **moderators**.

* `!admin version` - Responds with the current version of the setmod-bot package.
* `!admin refresh-mods` - Refresh the set of moderators in the bot. This is required if someone is modded or unmodded while the bot is running.
* `!admin settings <key>` - Read the value of a setting.
* `!admin settings <key> <value>` - Write the value of a setting.
* `!admin push` - Push a value to a setting which is a collection.
* `!admin delete <key> <value>` - Delete a value from a settings which is a collection.
* `!admin shutdown` - Cause the mod to cleanly shut down, and hopefully being restarted by the management process.
* `!admin enable-group <group>` - Enable all commands, aliases, and promotions part of the specified group.
* `!admin disable-group <group>` - Disable all commands, aliases, and promotions part of the specified group.

## Bad Words

Bad words filter looks at all words in a channel, converts them to singular and matches them phonetically against a word list.

The word list can be stored in the database with the `!badword edit <why>` command.
But you can also use a `bad_words.yml` file that looks like this:

```yaml
words:
 - word: cat
   why: Please don't talk about cats here {{name}} -___-
 - word: trump
```

If a word matches, the message will be deleted.

`why` is optional, but will be communicated to the user in case their message is deleted.
It supports the following template variables:

* `{{name}}` - the user who said the word.
* `{{target}}` - the channel where the word was sent.

## Commands

Every command is enabled through a Setting named `<command>/enabled`.

To for example enable the `!admin` command, you'd have to make sure the `admin/enabled` setting is set.

#### Misc Commands

You enable the `!admin` command by setting `admin/enabled` to `true`.

Available commands:

* `!uptime` - Get the current uptime.
* `!title` - Get the current title.
* `!title <title>` - Update the title to be `<title>`.
* `!game` - Get the current game.
* `!game <game>` - Update the game to be `<game>`.

#### `!command` command

You enable custom command administration by setting `command/enabled` to `true`.

Allows setting and requesting custom commands.

A command is the bot responding with a pre-defined message based on a template.

Available commands:

* `!command edit <name> <what>` - Set the command `<name>` to respond with `<what>` (**moderator**).
* `!command clear-group <name>` - Clear the group for command `<name>` (**moderator**).
* `!command group <name>` - Get the group the given command belongs to (**moderator**).
* `!command group <name> <group>` - Set the command `<name>` to be in the group `<group>` (**moderator**).
* `!command delete <name>` - Delete the command named `<name>` (**moderator**).
* `!command rename <from> <to>` - Rename the command `<from>` to `<to>` (**moderator**).

Template variables that can be used in `<what>`:

* `{{count}}` - The number of times the command has been invoked.
* `{{name}}` - The user who said the word.
* `{{target}}` - The channel where the word was sent.

#### `!alias` command

Allows setting custom aliases.
Aliases are prefixes that when invoked they will be expanded when processed by the bot.

For example, lets say we have an alias named `!sr` configured to `!song request {{rest}}`.
This would allow us to invoke `!sr don't call me` and it would be processed as `!song request don't call me`.

Available commands:

* `!alias edit <name> <what>` - Set the command `<name>` to alias to `<what>` (**moderator**).
* `!alias clear-group <name>` - Clear the group for alias `<name>` (**moderator**).
* `!alias group <name>` - Get the group the given alias belongs to (**moderator**).
* `!alias group <name> <group>` - Set the alias `<name>` to be in the group `<group>` (**moderator**).
* `!alias delete <name>` - Delete the command named `<name>` (**moderator**).
* `!alias rename <from> <to>` - Rename the command `<from>` to `<to>` (**moderator**).

Template variables that can be used in `<what>`:

* `{{rest}}` - The rest of the line being passed in.
* `{{name}}` - The user who invoked the alias.
* `{{target}}` - The channel where the alias was invoked.

###### Deprecated configuration `[[aliases]]`

Aliases used to be specified in the configuration.
If these are still present, the bot will migrate those aliases into the database and post a warning at startup.

The configuration used to look like this:

```toml
[[aliases]]
match = "!sr"
replace = "!song request {{rest}}"

[[aliases]]
match = "!sl"
replace = "!song list {{rest}}"

[[aliases]]
match = "!volume"
replace = "!song volume {{rest}}"
```

Now it's all handled using the `!alias` command.
