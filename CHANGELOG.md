[0.2.5]: https://github.com/udoprog/setmod/compare/0.2.4...0.2.5

## [0.2.4]

### Added
- Web-based overlay with current song ([#22]).
- Player will no longer pause the current song (if it's playing) and will instead synchronize the state of the player with Spotify ([#18]).
- Implement `!command rename <from> <to>`
- Ability to sync remote state of player with `[player] sync_player_interval = "10s"` ([#18]).
- Much more helpful guidance when using `!song` incorrectly.
- Store aliases in the database instead of the configuration. See the [`alias configuration`] for more details ([#24]).
- Start storing some settings in the database ([#19]).
  * Bot keeps track of first time it's being started to perform first-time configuration.
- Promotions through the `promotions` module. See the [`promotions configuration`] for more details ([#25]).

### Changed
- Cleaned up old cruft in the codebase (`gfx` module).
- Moved log configuration to external file (see [example log4rs.yaml]).
- No longer raise an error on bad input.
- UI is now built in React ([#23]).
  * This adds the `-WebRoot` option to [`tools/setmod.ps1`] to override where to load files from for development purposes.
- `.oauth2` state is now stored in the database under settings.

### Removed
- Removed `!counter` in favor of `!command` with same functionality. Using the `{{count}}` variable in the template will cause the count to be incremented.
- `[[aliases]]` section from configuration. Aliases are now stored in the database. The first time you run the bot it will migrate all the aliases into the database.
